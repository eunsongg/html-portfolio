<h3>Harry Potter Series</h3>
<p>I can never deny that this is my favorite movie series. While I watch them, I can escape from the toughness of reality and can be totally lost in the fantasy world.</p>

<h3>Home alone</h3>
<p>Even if I watch this in June, it's still enough to make me feel the happiness of Christmas.</p>

<h3>GATTACA</h3>
<P>It was my first Sci-fi movie and the fresh idea of future life amazinglyy shocked me.</P>
